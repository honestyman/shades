# Shades - A casual memory game for everyone
Shades is a mini number and color game. Players would have to challenge their focusing skills and memory capacity under a time limit.

This browser based game was created for a software engineering subject and was finished right before graduation. Had a lot of fun doing this kind of beginner project.

## Clone and play the game
  - Clone the repository
  - Run your localhost php env
  - Import the mysql db
  - Play the game as guest

## How to play
  - In the grid, notice that there are four different shades of blue. Sequence them in your mind from lightest to darkest.
  - Memorize the smallest number in each shade, from lightest to darkest.
  - Note that if you have misclicked boxes that are not in the proper sequence, you'll get a wrong answer. You can still complete the level by finding the remaining values in the sequence.
  - You have three lives. Memorize and complete the sequence then proceed to the next level! Goodluck and have fun!

## Possible Enhancements
  - **feature** Overall The game is limited to one shade of color only. Random color (and its shade) would be cool to implement.
  - **hint feature** Mark all the remaining answers.
  - **hint feature** Mark all boxes of the next shades for the next answer.
  - **challenge** Changing guide.
  - **challenge** Toggling grid simultaneously with timer.
  - **overall** Mobile responsiveness.

## Todos
  - [ ] Create Shades v2 with enhancements mentioned above.
